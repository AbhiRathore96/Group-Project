One of the earliest references to Kedarnath occurs in the Skanda Purana (c. 7th-8th century), which names Kedara (Kedarnath) as the place where Shiva released the holy waters of Ganga from his matted hair, resulting in the formation of the Ganges River.[9]
                    Kedarnath was a prominent pilgrimage centre by the 12th century when it is mentioned in Kritya-kalpataru written by the Gahadavala minister Bhatta Lakshmidhara.[11]

It is one of the four sites in India's Chota Char Dham pilgrimage. The sacred shrine of Yamunotri, source of the river Yamuna, is the westernmost shrine in the Garhwal Himalayas, perched atop a flank of the Bandarpunch mountain. The chief attraction at Yamunotri is the temple devoted to the Goddess Yamuna and the holy thermal springs at Janki Chatti which is 7 km away.
                    The actual source, a frozen lake of ice and glacier (Champasar Glacier) located on the Kalind Mountain at a height of 4,421 m above sea level, about 1 km further up, is not frequented generally as it is not accessible; hence the shrine has been located on the foot of the hill. The approach is extremely difficult and pilgrims therefore offer puja at the temple itself.

It is a pilgrimage site for worshipping the deity Krishna and Barbarika who is often venerated as a shyam baba . Devotees believe the temple houses the head of Barbarika or Khatu-shyam, a legendary warrior who sacrifices his head upon the request of Krishna during the antebellum of the Kurukshetra War.
                    Barbarika (Barbarīka) in Hinduism is the son of Ghatotkacha (son of Bhima) and Princess Maurvi, daughter of Daitya Moora,[1] though other references state that he was a warrior from the south. He is a folk character and is not attested in the Mahabharata.
                    In Nepal, Kirati king Yalambar is believed to be the Barbarik of Mahabharata, son of Ghatotkach and grandson of Bheem. Legend credits him with meeting Indra, the lord of heaven, who ventured into the Valley in human guise, while natives of the Kathmandu Valley portray him as Akash Bhairav.[2]

                    Moinuddin Chishti was a 13th-century Sufi saint and philosopher. Born in Sanjar (of modern-day Iran), or in Sijistan,[2] he arrived in Delhi during the reign of the Sultan Iltutmish (d. 1236). Moinuddin moved from Delhi to Ajmer shortly thereafter, at which point he became increasingly influenced by the writings of the famous Sunni Hanbali scholar and mystic ʿAbdallāh Anṣārī (d. 1088), whose famous work on the lives of the early Islamic saints, the Ṭabāqāt al-ṣūfiyya, may have played a role in shaping Moinuddin's worldview. It was during his time in Ajmer that Moinuiddin acquired the reputation of being a charismatic and compassionate spiritual preacher and teacher; and biographical accounts of his life written after his death report that he received the gifts of many "spiritual marvels (karāmāt), such as miraculous travel, clairvoyance, and visions of angels" in these years of his life.

                <span>Sai Baba of Shirdi (c. 1838–15 October 1918),[2] also known as Shirdi Sai Baba, was an Indian spiritual master considered to be a saint,[3] and revered by both Hindu and Muslim devotees during and after his lifetime.

                    According to accounts from his life, Sai Baba preached the importance of "realisation of the self" and criticised "love towards perishable things". His teachings concentrated on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to God and Guru.
                    
                    Sai Baba condemned discrimination based on religion or caste. He had both Hindu and Muslim followers, but when pressed on his own religious affiliations, he refused to identify himself with one to the exclusion of the other.[4]: 3  His teachings combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived,[5] practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, and taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions.</span>

It is famous for being the place where Gautama Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment (Pali: bodhi) under what became known as the Bodhi Tree.[2] Since antiquity, Bodh Gayā has remained the object of pilgrimage and veneration, for both Hindus and Buddhists.[3] In particular, archaeological finds, including sculptures, show that the site was in use by Buddhists since the Mauryan period.[4] Bodh Gayā and the nearby regions were invaded and destroyed in the 12th century CE by Muslim Turk armies, led by Delhi Sultanate's Qutb al-Din Aibak and Bakhtiyar Khilji.

                    For Buddhists, Bodh Gayā is the most important of the four main pilgrimage sites related to the life of Gautama Buddha,[5] the other three being Kushinagar, Lumbini.</span>
